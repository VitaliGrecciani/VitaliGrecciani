# Hi, I'm Vitali Grecciani

I'm a full-stack developer based in Austria, building modern web products with an AI layer: RAG/search, content ingestion pipelines, and automation.

### How I work

I focus on **building complete products**.

My workflow leverages **AI tools** to accelerate development. This allows me to move quickly from a concept to a working executable, dedicating more time to architecture, privacy, and the final user experience.

**My primary toolkit:**
* **Core:** React, Next.js, Electron
* **Style:** Tailwind CSS, Modern UI principles
* **AI:** LLMs (Claude, Gemini) for efficient implementation

## Featured project

### Logosphäre (Austrian tax knowledge platform)
Repository: https://github.com/VitaliGrecciani/tax-knowledge-platform

- Next.js + Prisma + PostgreSQL foundation with committed migrations
- RAG-ready schema (pgvector-backed embeddings table) + indexing pipeline
- Server endpoints for retrieval/search and scheduled content sync
- NextAuth-based authentication and a clean reading/discussion experience
- Tests: unit/integration (Vitest) and E2E (Playwright)

## Currently exploring

- More robust RAG pipelines (quality, evaluation, cost control)
- Agentic workflows and external AI backends (proxy-style integrations)
- Production hardening: observability, reliability, security, DX
