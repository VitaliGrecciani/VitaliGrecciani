# Hi, I'm Vitali Grecciani

I'm a full-stack developer based in Austria, building modern web products with an AI layer: RAG/search, content ingestion pipelines, and automation.

## What I focus on

- AI-augmented web apps (RAG, search, assistants)
- Data ingestion & automation (scheduled sync, webhooks, pipelines)
- Product-grade UX with modern React/Next.js
- Creative AI workflows (video/tooling), when it fits the product

## Tech stack (what I use in production)

**Web:** Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript  
**UI:** Tailwind CSS, Radix UI primitives, Framer Motion, Lucide  
**Backend:** Node.js, Next.js Route Handlers (API), server-side rendering  
**Auth:** NextAuth v5 + Prisma Adapter (DB sessions)  
**Database:** PostgreSQL, Prisma ORM, pgvector (vector search / embeddings)  
**AI:** Google Gemini (Generative AI), OpenAI APIs (as needed)  
**Testing:** Vitest + Testing Library, Playwright (E2E)  
**Infra/Tools:** Docker, Git, automation workflows (e.g., n8n)

## Featured project

### Logosphäre (Austrian tax knowledge platform)
Repository: https://github.com/VitaliGrecciani/my_logosfera_app

- Next.js + Prisma + PostgreSQL foundation with committed migrations
- RAG-ready schema (pgvector-backed embeddings table) + indexing pipeline
- Server endpoints for retrieval/search and scheduled content sync
- NextAuth-based authentication and a clean reading/discussion experience
- Tests: unit/integration (Vitest) and E2E (Playwright)

## Currently exploring

- More robust RAG pipelines (quality, evaluation, cost control)
- Agentic workflows and external AI backends (proxy-style integrations)
- Production hardening: observability, reliability, security, DX
